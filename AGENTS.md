## Rule: CLAUDE

# AGENTS.md

This file provides Claude Code guidance for ClaudeKit Engineer. The CK CLI installs it with the rest of the AI-facing rules under `$HOME/AGENTS.md`.

## Role & Responsibilities

Your role is to analyze user requirements, delegate tasks to appropriate sub-agents, and ensure cohesive delivery of features that meet specifications and architectural standards.

## Workflows

- Primary workflow: `$HOME/AGENTS.md`
- Development rules: `$HOME/AGENTS.md`
- Orchestration protocols: `$HOME/AGENTS.md`
- Documentation management: `$HOME/AGENTS.md`
- And other workflows: `$HOME/AGENTS.md*`

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** DO NOT modify skills in `~/.claude/skills` directory directly. **MUST** modify skills in this current working directory. Unless you are asked to do so.
**IMPORTANT:** You must follow strictly the development rules in `$HOME/AGENTS.md` file.
**IMPORTANT:** Before you plan or proceed any implementation, always read the `./README.md` file first to get context.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## Git

**DO NOT** use `chore` and `docs` in commit messages of file changes in `.claude` directory.

## Hook Response Protocol

### Privacy Block Hook (`@@PRIVACY_PROMPT@@`)

When a tool call is blocked by the privacy-block hook, the output contains a JSON marker between `@@PRIVACY_PROMPT_START@@` and `@@PRIVACY_PROMPT_END@@`. **You MUST use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** to get proper user approval.

**Required Flow:**

1. Parse the JSON from the hook output
2. Use `AskUserQuestion` with the question data from the JSON
3. Based on user's selection:
   - **"Yes, approve access"** → Use `bash cat "filepath"` to read the file (bash is auto-approved)
   - **"No, skip this file"** → Continue without accessing the file

**Example AskUserQuestion call:**
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "I need to read \".env\" which may contain sensitive data. Do you approve?",
    "header": "File Access",
    "options": [
      { "label": "Yes, approve access", "description": "Allow reading .env this time" },
      { "label": "No, skip this file", "description": "Continue without accessing this file" }
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` first. Never try to work around the privacy block without explicit user approval.

## Python Scripts (Skills)

When running Python scripts from `$HOME/.agents/skills/`, use the venv Python interpreter:
- **Linux/macOS:** `$HOME/.agents/skills/.venv/bin/python3 scripts/xxx.py`
- **Windows:** `.claude\skills\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\xxx.py`

This ensures packages installed by `install.sh` (google-genai, pypdf, etc.) are available.

**IMPORTANT:** When scripts of skills failed, don't stop, try to fix them directly.

## [IMPORTANT] Consider Modularization
- If a code file exceeds 200 lines of code, consider modularizing it
- Check existing modules before creating new
- Analyze logical separation boundaries (functions, classes, concerns)
- Use kebab-case naming with long descriptive names, it's fine if the file name is long because this ensures file names are self-documenting for LLM tools (Grep, Glob, Search)
- Write descriptive code comments
- After modularization, continue with main task
- When not to modularize: Markdown files, plain text files, bash scripts, configuration files, environment variables files, etc.

## Documentation Management

We keep all important docs in `.` folder and keep updating them, structure like below:

```
./docs
├── project-overview-pdr.md
├── code-standards.md
├── codebase-summary.md
├── design-guidelines.md
├── deployment-guide.md
├── system-architecture.md
└── project-roadmap.md
```

**IMPORTANT:** *MUST READ* and *MUST COMPLY* all *INSTRUCTIONS* in `$HOME/AGENTS.md`, especially *WORKFLOWS* section is *CRITICALLY IMPORTANT*, this rule is *MANDATORY. NON-NEGOTIABLE. NO EXCEPTIONS. MUST REMEMBER AT ALL TIMES!!!*
---

## Rule: orchestration-protocol

# Orchestration Protocol

## Delegation Context (MANDATORY)

When spawning subagents via subtask delegation, **ALWAYS** include in prompt:

1. **Work Context Path**: The git root of the PRIMARY files being worked on
2. **Reports Path**: `{work_context}/plans/reports/` for that project
3. **Plans Path**: `{work_context}` for that project

**Example:**
```
Task prompt: "Fix parser bug.
Work context: /path/to/project-b
Reports: /path/to/project-b/plans/reports/
Plans: /path/to/project-b/plans/"
```

**Rule:** If CWD differs from work context (editing files in different project), use the **work context paths**, not CWD paths.
---

#### Sequential Chaining
Chain subagents when tasks have dependencies or require outputs from previous steps:
- **Planning → Implementation → Simplification → Testing → Review**: Use for feature development (tests verify simplified code)
- **Research → Design → Code → Documentation**: Use for new system components
- Each agent completes fully before the next begins
- Pass context and outputs between agents in the chain

#### Parallel Execution
Spawn multiple subagents simultaneously for independent tasks:
- **Code + Tests + Docs**: When implementing separate, non-conflicting components
- **Multiple Feature Branches**: Different agents working on isolated features
- **Cross-platform Development**: iOS and Android specific implementations
- **Careful Coordination**: Ensure no file conflicts or shared resource contention
- **Merge Strategy**: Plan integration points before parallel execution begins
---

## Subagent Status Protocol

Subagents MUST report one of these statuses when completing work:

| Status | Meaning | Controller Action |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **DONE** | Task completed successfully | Proceed to next step (review, next task) |
| **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** | Completed but flagged doubts | Read concerns → address if correctness/scope issue → proceed if observational |
| **BLOCKED** | Cannot complete task | Assess blocker → provide context / break task / escalate to user |
| **NEEDS_CONTEXT** | Missing information to proceed | Provide missing context → re-dispatch |

### Handling Rules

- **Never** ignore BLOCKED or NEEDS_CONTEXT — something must change before retry
- **Never** force same approach after BLOCKED — try: more context → simpler task → more capable model → escalate
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** about file growth or tech debt → note for future, proceed now
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** about correctness → address before review
- If subagent fails 3+ times on same task → escalate to user, don't retry blindly

### Reporting Format

Subagents should end their response with:

```
**Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
**Summary:** [1-2 sentence summary]
**Concerns/Blockers:** [if applicable]
```
---

## Context Isolation Principle

**Subagents receive only the context they need.** Never pass full session history.

### Rules

1. **Craft prompts explicitly** — Provide task description, relevant file paths, acceptance criteria. Not "here's what we discussed."
2. **No session history** — Subagent gets fresh context. Summarize relevant decisions, don't replay conversation.
3. **Scope file references** — List specific files to read/modify. Not "look at the codebase."
4. **Include plan context** — If working from a plan, provide the specific phase text, not the entire plan.
5. **Preserve controller context** — Coordination work stays in main agent. Don't dump coordination details into subagent prompts.

### Prompt Template

```
Task: [specific task description]
Files to modify: [list]
Files to read for context: [list]
Acceptance criteria: [list]
Constraints: [any relevant constraints]
Plan reference: [phase file path if applicable]

Work context: [project path]
Reports: [reports path]
```

### Anti-Patterns

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "Continue from where we left off" | "Implement X feature per spec in phase-02.md" |
| "Fix the issues we discussed" | "Fix null check in auth.ts:45, root cause: missing validation" |
| "Look at the codebase and figure out" | "Read src/api/routes.ts and add POST  endpoint" |
| Passing 50+ lines of conversation | 5-line task summary with file paths |

## Agent Teams (Optional)

For multi-session parallel collaboration, activate the `` skill.
Not part of the default orchestration workflow. See `$HOME/.agents/skills/team/SKILL.md` for templates, decision criteria, and spawn instructions.
---

## Rule: review-audit-self-decision

# AGENTS.md Rules Summary — Review/Audit + Comments + Self-Decision

## 1. Verified Decisions Are Sticky — Audit Does Not Auto-Reverse

- Once a decision is verified (read source, ran tests, empirical experiment), lock it with a source note: `verified by {file:line}` or `verified by test {name}`.
- An audit/red-team counter-argument **alone is insufficient** to revise. Only revise when:
  - Audit finds a **new** issue the verification missed (state the issue + why prior check missed it).
  - Or context changed since verification (codebase moved, business decision changed).
- After verifying, prune stale risk rows / unresolved questions from reports.
- Surface contradictions on verified decisions to user as: "audit says X, but Y is verified by {source} — does the audit bring new data to justify a reverse?" Do NOT silently flip.

## 2. Validate Audit Findings Against Real Threat Model

Before applying a finding flagged "too narrow / too loose / risky":

1. Identify what the code **actually stores/protects**.
2. Walk each scenario the reviewer flagged through that lens. Does it actually produce the bad outcome? Often "theoretically yes, practically no".
3. Separate real risks from abstract worries. Real → fix; non-real → document rationale; borderline → ask user.
4. Look for the failure mode the reviewer missed — often the real bug sits one step away from what was flagged.

Anti-pattern: accepting every "widen/harden/add-check" recommendation without tracing it to a real failure mode.

## 3. Guard User Decisions Against Audit/YAGNI Drift

**NEVER silently reverse decisions the user has already confirmed.**

Before any cut/change from audit:

1. **Trace before cutting:** check if user explicitly chose that value/design.
2. **Categorize:**
   - ✅ Safe to apply: cuts of items Claude proposed that user never explicitly confirmed.
   - ⚠️ Must confirm first: anything touching user's explicit answer — thresholds, scope, library, schema, phase, feature inclusion/exclusion.
   - 🚫 Never auto-reverse: business decisions (pricing, timing, scope boundaries, compliance).
3. **Surface reversals:** present (a) user's original decision verbatim, (b) audit reasoning, (c) trade-off, (d) explicit ask "keep / change per audit / hybrid?". Do NOT apply.
4. **Document drift:** annotate cuts with reason + user-confirmation trail.
5. **Auditor bias awareness:** audits lean YAGNI/minimalism — they are **input to user**, not orders to Claude.

Red flags: changing a numeric threshold user picked, removing a column/field user mentioned, swapping library, moving scope across phases, cutting a feature user confirmed.

Rule of thumb: if unsure whether a cut reverses user intent, ask. Cost of 1 clarifying question ≪ cost of silent regression at demo.

## 4. Scout-First, Ask-Second (Confidence Score)

For any question answerable by grep/read on the codebase:

1. **Scout first:** grep, read live code, check current state.
2. **Self-rate confidence (0–100%):**
   - **≥ ~85%** → answer directly with `path:line` citation.
   - **< 85%** → ask user.
3. **Only ask when:**
   - Confidence < 85% (missing data, ambiguous).
   - Real conflict between 2+ sources (not a stale note already verified).
   - Anomaly requiring user judgment (business decision, UX trade-off, scope expansion).
   - High-reversibility risk (destructive op, breaking change, deploy-affecting).

Anti-pattern: asking what grep can answer in 5s.
Good pattern: scout → "verified at `file:line`, confidence 95%, applying X" — verified + concise.

## 5. Code Comments & Artifact Naming — No Plan References

Code comments and file names (including SQL migrations) **must not reference plan artifacts**: phase numbers, finding codes (F1, F13, Y1, CU2…), audit labels (audit A4), red-team labels, brainstorm sections (§5.4), plan taxonomy.

**Why:** plan headers change/get renumbered/disappear → references become unresolvable noise. The *reason* for code (invariant, race, trade-off) must be stable and self-contained.

### Rules

- **Explain the why, not the origin.** Write "org-scoped advisory lock serializes concurrent reassigns" — NOT "per F13 advisory-lock fix".
- **Migration filenames:** domain slug only — `000003_polymorphic_permission_groups.up.sql` (NOT `000003_phase_0a_...`).
- **Test names:** describe scenario — `TestReassignPrimaryDept_Concurrent` (NOT `_F13`).
- **Commit messages:** describe the change, not the finding code.
- Plan refs belong in `plans/…XX-*.md` and PR descriptions, not in code.

### Allowed in code

- Function/symbol names in the same codebase.
- Stable external IDs: RFC numbers, PostgreSQL SQLSTATE, CVE IDs, durable issue numbers.

## Usage Notes

- Pick ONE skill per distinct user intent
- If a task spans two domains (e.g. "build + deploy"), suggest the primary skill and mention the secondary
- Domain skills combine with core workflow: `` → domain skill → ``
- Skills not listed here are either core workflow skills (see `skill-workflow-routing.md`) or utility skills activated on demand (e.g. ``, ``, ``)
---

## Rule: skill-workflow-routing

# Skill Workflow Routing

When orchestrating multi-step tasks, consider these workflow sequences. Skills are listed in typical execution order.

## Core Development Workflow

```
/ck:plan → /ck:cook → /ck:test → /ck:code-review → /ck:ship → /ck:journal
```

| User Intent | Suggested Start |
|-------------|----------------|
| "implement feature X", "build X", "add X" | `` then `` |
| "execute this plan" | ` <plan-path>` |
| "quick implementation" | ` --fast` |

## Bugfix Workflow

```
/ck:scout → /ck:debug → /ck:fix → /ck:test → /ck:code-review
```

| User Intent | Suggested Start |
|-------------|----------------|
| "X is broken", "error in X", "bug in X" | `` (auto-scouts internally) |
| "CI is failing", "tests broken" | ` --auto` |
| "investigate why X happens" | `` then `` |

## Investigation Workflow

```
/ck:scout → /ck:debug → /ck:brainstorm → /ck:plan
```

| User Intent | Suggested Start |
|-------------|----------------|
| "understand how X works" | `` |
| "why is X happening" | `` |
| "explore options for X" | `` then `` |

## Post-Implementation Checklist

After completing implementation work, consider:
- `` — review changes before merging
- `` — run full shipping pipeline (tests, review, version, PR)
- `` — document decisions and lessons learned

## Setup Skills

Before starting implementation in a shared codebase:
- `` — create isolated worktree for the feature/fix
- `` — discover relevant files and code patterns
---

## Rule: team-coordination-rules

# Team Coordination Rules

> These rules only apply when operating as a teammate within an Agent Team.
> They have no effect on standard sessions or subagent workflows.

Rules for agents operating as teammates within an Agent Team.

## File Ownership (CRITICAL)

- Each teammate MUST own distinct files — no overlapping edits
- Define ownership via glob patterns in task descriptions: `File ownership: src/api/*, src/models/*`
- Lead resolves ownership conflicts by restructuring tasks or handling shared files directly
- Tester owns test files only; reads implementation files but never edits them
- If ownership violation detected: STOP and report to lead immediately

## Git Safety

- Prefer git worktrees for implementation teams — each dev in own worktree eliminates conflicts
- Never force-push from a teammate session
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- Pull before push to catch merge conflicts early
- If working in a git worktree, commit/push to the worktree branch — not main or dev

## Communication Protocol

- Include actionable findings in messages, not just "I'm done"
- Never send structured JSON status messages — use plain text

## CK Stack Conventions

### Report Output
- Save reports to `{CK_REPORTS_PATH}` (injected via hook, fallback: `plans/reports/`)
- Naming: `{type}-{date}-{slug}.md` where type = your role (researcher, reviewer, debugger)
- Sacrifice grammar for concision. List unresolved questions at end.

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- No AI references in commit messages
- Keep commits focused on actual code changes

### Docs Sync (Implementation Teams Only)
- After completing implementation tasks, lead MUST evaluate docs impact
- State explicitly: `Docs impact: [none|minor|major]`
- If impact: update `docs/` directory or note in completion message

## Task Claiming

- Claim lowest-ID unblocked task first (earlier tasks set up context for later ones)
- Check `TaskList` after completing each task for newly unblocked work
- Set task to `in_progress` before starting work
- If all tasks blocked, notify lead and offer to help unblock

## Plan Approval Flow

When `plan_mode_required` is set:
1. Research and plan your approach (read-only — no file edits)
2. Send plan via `ExitPlanMode` — this triggers approval request to lead
3. Wait for lead's `plan_approval_response`
4. If rejected: revise based on feedback, resubmit
5. If approved: proceed with implementation

## Conflict Resolution

- If two teammates need the same file: escalate to lead immediately
- If a teammate's plan is rejected twice: lead takes over that task
- If findings conflict between reviewers: lead synthesizes and documents disagreement
- If blocked by another teammate's incomplete work: message them directly first, escalate to lead if unresponsive

## Shutdown Protocol

- Approve shutdown requests unless mid-critical-operation
- Always mark current task as completed before approving shutdown
- If rejecting shutdown, explain why concisely
- Extract `requestId` from shutdown request JSON and pass to `shutdown_response`

## Idle State (Normal Behavior)

- Going idle after sending a message is NORMAL — not an error
- Idle means waiting for input, not disconnected
- Sending a message to an idle teammate wakes them up
- Do not treat idle notifications as completion signals — check task status instead

## Discovery

- Read team config at `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json` to discover teammates
- Always refer to teammates by NAME (not agent ID)
